# Dayjs-Calendar-App
This is a simple calendar app I created using jquery and day.js to practice my skills.

NOTE: The color-coded schedule only works between the hours of 9 AM and 5 PM. After 9 AM each day, the schedule will reset to to the correct colors. After 5 PM, the schedule will display the class of .past.
